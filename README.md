# Description:

This project is a modularized tool that aids in managing telnet connections, reading XML data, configuring application parameters, and storing data into SQLite databases. With the use of Qt framework and Python libraries, the application is efficient, responsive, and user-friendly.

## Features:

    Telnet Connector: Establishes a telnet connection to a server, sends and receives data, and emits signals to notify of the connection status and incoming data.

    Config Manager: Loads and saves application configurations, providing a default configuration if none exists.

    XML Scanner: Parses XML files from a specified directory, extracts relevant data based on certain attributes, and returns these values to the caller.

    Database Manager: Handles operations with SQLite databases such as creating or updating tables, inserting new data, checking if certain entries exist, and removing old data.
